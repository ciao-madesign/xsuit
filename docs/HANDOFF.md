# HANDOFF

Read this first in a fresh session, then `docs/05-decisions.md` and `docs/06-builds.md`.

## What the project is

A browser extension (Chrome, TypeScript, MV3) that adapts a web page's UX to the conventions of a target market (V1: Western-oriented vs China-oriented), reversibly and locally, driven by declarative rules. Full context: docs 01–04.

## State (2026-11-09)

- Repo `ciao-madesign/xsuit`, branch `claude/great-curie-8yfsjr`. Only documentation exists; B0 done (scaffold + toolchain).
- Docs 01–06 written in English. README lists the reading order.
- Decisions made: user = UX designer/researcher; stack = TypeScript + Chrome MV3; everything in English; sites = paired Western + Chinese set (Google/Baidu, Amazon/Alibaba, BBC/Chinese entertainment, Guardian/non-state Chinese news, YouTube-Reddit-Instagram/Weibo-WeChat-RED); see `05-decisions.md`.
- Build plan B0–B8 defined in `docs/06-builds.md`. B0-B3 complete; B4 next.

## How the user wants to work

- Short, concise, non-technical replies unless asked. User writes in Italian; the project is in English.
- Propose open decisions **one at a time**, wait for the answer, record it in `docs/05-decisions.md`.
- No PR unless explicitly requested. Commit and push to `claude/great-curie-8yfsjr`.

## Standing rule from the user

Every intervention must be motivated and justified; every rule must be traceable to real studies or to observations/data, with stated limits. Never invent citations. Source registry: `rules/sources.json`; audit: `docs/07-evidence-audit.md`. Primary texts are not yet re-verified (flag `verified:false`).

## Next steps

1. Start **B4 (Visual transformations)**: design-token effect catalog (every value justified), first adapter (search engine: Google/Baidu).
2. Source verification is pending: the primary texts of li2022, li2026, nng2016 could not be fetched (hosts ieeexplore.ieee.org, journals.sagepub.com, www.nngroup.com are blocked by the session network). Ask the user to allow them or verify figures manually.

Commands: `npm run check`, `npm run evidence` (regenerates docs/07).
B3 delivered: `src/engine/` (plan, apply, journal, css, protect, engine), content script wired to settings; 57 tests; checked in real Chromium (apply and restore).
